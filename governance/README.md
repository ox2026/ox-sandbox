# Governance

This repository is created from the Ox template.

Key rules:
- Protected branches (e.g. `main`) require pull requests
- Direct pushes to protected branches are forbidden
- Changes require approval from the code owner
- Automation (Ox) may propose changes but must not execute without approval

GitHub branch protection is enforced at the platform level.
